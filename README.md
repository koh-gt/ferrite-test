![204157973-5025ca19-d12b-4656-9b7a-2f3956b34c9f-testnet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101822992/233868409-00537fe5-17b3-49c6-827e-77e1a338536c.png)

## Features:
### 1 minute block time - 
Transactions are received instantly and can be confirmed within minutes.

### 1 hour difficulty adjustment time - 
Difficulty adjusts in 60 blocks, allowing for dynamic difficulty adaptation.
> If mining hashrate spikes, difficulty will quickly rise to limit supply.
> If mining hashrate plummets, difficulty will quickly drop to encourage mining.

### Limited supply - 
A maximum of $100$ FEC (Ferrite coins) are mined in a block. 
This number will halve every $301107$ blocks, or about 8 months considering block propagation time.
> There will be no more than $60,221,400$ FEC. $10^{16}$ times smaller than Avogadro's number!

### Transparency - 
No pre-mine - Linux Executables are uploaded on public Telegram and Discord groups as early as block 120 (2 hours), with full migration to Github by block 3000 (50 hours).

### Decentralised - 
Ferrite has no owner. The miners shall decide the fate of the network.

### Pseudonymous -
Nobody knows who owns the mined coins, nor who sent the coins. Unless you identify as the owner of the public address, you maintain anonymity.

### Scrypt Algorithm -  
Reuse obsolete Litecoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum / Classic miners to mine Ferrite. Originally designed to be ASIC resistant.
